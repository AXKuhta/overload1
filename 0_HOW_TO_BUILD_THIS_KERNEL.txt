1. Preparations:
 Make sure that your system install has all the necessary packages for building a Linux kernel.
 Get an uber aarch64 gcc: https://bitbucket.org/UBERTC/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/downloads/ (This repository contains prebuilt binaries).
 Commands below assume that you placed  the gcc in the ~/ubergcc/ directory.

2. Building:
  sudo -s #File permission problems occur without root
  export CROSS_COMPILE=~/ubergcc/bin/aarch64-linux-android-
  export ARCH=arm64
  make lineage_s2_defconfig
  make -j8

3. Installing:
 After the build finishes, and if it finishes without errors, the built kernel file is ./arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz-dtb
 Rename it to zImage and replace an old zImage in the kernel installation zip.
 That's all, the installation zip is ready to flash.
