1. Preparations:
 Make sure that your system install has all the necessary packages for building a Linux kernel.
 I tested this only with GCC 6.3.0 from gcc-6-aarch64-linux-gnu package (Available in Debian and Ubuntu repositories)
 It's presumed that /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-android-* is symlinked to /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-android-*-6 via update-alternatives. It _may_ be done automatically during the package installation, but I don't remember for sure.

2. Building:
  sudo -s #File permission problems occur without root
  export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-android-
  export ARCH=arm64
  make lineage_s2_defconfig
  make -j8

3. Installing:
 After the build finishes, and if it finishes without errors, the built kernel file is ./arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz-dtb
 Rename it to zImage and replace an old zImage in the kernel installation zip.
 That's all, the installation zip is ready to flash.
